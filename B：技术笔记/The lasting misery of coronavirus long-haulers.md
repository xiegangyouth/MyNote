# The lasting misery of coronavirus long-haulers（冠状病毒长期感染者的持久苦难）

*Months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, some people are still battling crushing fatigue, lung damage and other symptoms of ‘long COVID’.*

> 在感染SARS-CoV-2的几个月后，一些人依旧在与 极度疲惫 、 肺部损伤 及 冠状病毒所引起的疾病的其他症状 。

The lung scans were the first sign of trouble. In the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, clinical radiologist Ali Gholamrezanezhad began to notice that some people who had cleared their COVID-19 infection still had distinct signs of damage. “Unfortunately, sometimes the scar never goes away,” he says.

> 肺部扫描是出现问题的第一个迹象。在冠状病毒开始大规模传染的头几个星期，临床放射学家Ali Gholamrezanezhad开始察觉到，一些已经清除了冠状病毒感染的人仍有明显的受损迹象。他说：“不幸的是，有时候伤疤永远都不会消失”。

Gholamrezanezhad, at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and his team started tracking patients in January using computed tomography (CT) scanning to study their lungs. They followed up on 33 of them more than a month later, and their as-yet-unpublished data suggest that more than one-third had tissue death that has led to visible scars. The team plans to follow the group for several years.

> 位于洛杉矶的南加州大学的Gholamrezanezhad和他的团队从一月份开始使用计算机CT扫描去研究病人的肺部。一个多月之后，他们对其中的33名病人进行了跟踪调查，他们尚未发表的数据显示，超过1/3的人组织坏死，并留下了明显的伤疤。这个团队计划跟随这组病人数年。

These patients are likely to represent the worst-case scenario. Because most infected people do not end up in hospital, Gholamrezanezhad says the overall rate of such intermediate-term lung damage is likely to be much lower — his best guess is that it is less than 10%. Nevertheless, given that 28.2 million people are known to have been infected so far, and that the lungs are just one of the places that clinicians have detected damage, even that low percentage implies that hundreds of thousands of people are experiencing lasting health consequences.

> 这些病人可能代表着最坏的情况。由于大多数感染者最终不会住院，Gholamrezanezhad 说，这种中期肺损伤的总体发生率可能要低得多——他最乐观的估计是低于10%。然而，鉴于目前为止已有2820万人受到感染，而肺部只是临床医师检测到的受损地方之一，即使这一比例很低，这也意味着有数十万人正遭受持久的健康后果。

Doctors are now concerned that the pandemic will lead to a significant surge of people battling lasting illnesses and disabilities. Because the disease is so new, no one knows yet what the long-term impacts will be. Some of the damage is likely to be a side effect of intensive treatments such as intubation, whereas other lingering problems could be caused by the virus itself. But preliminary studies and existing research into other coronaviruses suggest that the virus can injure multiple organs and cause some surprising symptoms.

> 医生们现在担心，大流行病将会导致与持久疾病和残疾作斗争的人数大幅增加。因为这种病太新奇了，所以没有人知道它长期的影响是什么样的。其中一些损伤可能是诸如插管之类的强化治疗手段的副作用，而其他挥之不去的问题可能是由病毒自身引起的。但是对其他冠状病毒的初步研究和现有研究表明，病毒能够损害多个器官并引起一些惊人的症状。

People with more severe infections might experience long-term damage not just in their lungs, but in their heart, immune system, brain and elsewhere. Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, suggests that these effects can last for years.

> 感染更加严重的人可能不仅在肺部，还有心脏、免疫系统、大脑和其他部位都将遭受损伤。先前冠状病毒爆发的证据，尤其是严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）流行病，表明这些影响可能持续数年。

And although in some cases the most severe infections also cause the worst long-term impacts, even mild cases can have life-changing effects — notably a lingering malaise similar to chronic fatigue syndrome.

> 尽管在某些情况下，最严重的感染也会造成最严重的长期影响，但即使是轻微感染也带来改变生活的影响——尤其是与慢性疲劳综合征类似的挥之不去的不适感。

Many researchers are now launching follow-up studies of people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Several of these focus on damage to specific organs or systems; others plan to track a range of effects. In the United Kingdom, the Post-Hospitalisation COVID-19 Study (PHOSP-COVID) aims to follow 10,000 patients for a year, analysing clinical factors such as blood tests and scans, and collecting data on biomarkers. A similar study of hundreds of people over 2 years launched in the United States at the end of July.

> 许多研究人员目前正在对感染了导致SARS-CoV-2（引起COVID-19的病毒）的人进行跟踪研究。其中一些是集中在特定器官或者系统的损害上；其他人则计划跟踪一系列的影响。在英国，PHOSP-COVID的目标是跟踪一万名病人一年时间，分析注入血液测试和扫描等临床因素，并收集生物标记的数据。7月底，一项为期两年的针对数百人的类似研究在美国启动。

What they find will be crucial in treating those with lasting symptoms and trying to prevent new infections from lingering. “We need clinical guidelines on what this care of survivors of COVID-19 should look like,” says Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious-diseases clinician at Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts, who is setting up a clinic to support people with COVID-19. “That can’t evolve until we quantify the problem.”

> 他们的发现对于治疗具有持续症状的人和防止新感染的发生至关重要。马萨诸塞州波士顿大学医学院的传染病临床医师Nahid Bhadelia说：“我们需要关于新冠肺炎幸存者如何护理的临床指南。”他正在建立一家诊所来支持新冠肺炎患者。“在我们量化问题之前，这是无法发展的”。

## Enduring effects（持续的影响）

In the first few months of the pandemic, as governments scrambled to stem the spread by implementing lockdowns and hospitals struggled to cope with the tide of cases, most research focused on treating or preventing infection.

> 在疫情爆发的最初几个月里，随着各国政府争相实施封锁以遏制疫情的蔓延，同时医院也在努力处理大量的病例，大部分研究集中于治疗或者防御感染上。

Doctors were well aware that viral infections could lead to chronic illness, but exploring that was not a priority. “At the beginning, everything was acute, and now we’re recognizing that there may be more problems,” says Helen Su, an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. “There is a definite need for long-term studies.”

> 医生们很清楚，病毒感染可能会导致慢性疾病，但是探索它不是优先考虑的事。马里兰州贝塞斯达国家过敏和传染病研究所的免疫学家海伦·苏（Helen Su）说：“起初，万事紧急，现在我们意识到还存在更多问题。”“确实需要进行长期研究”。

The obvious place to check for long-term harm is in the lungs, because COVID-19 begins as a respiratory infection. Few peer-reviewed studies exploring lasting lung damage have been published. Gholamrezanezhad’s team analysed lung CT images of 919 patients from published studies[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR1), and found that the lower lobes of the lungs are the most frequently damaged. The scans were riddled with opaque patches that indicate inflammation, that might make it difficult to breathe during sustained exercise. Visible damage normally reduced after two weeks[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR1). An Austrian study also found that lung damage lessened with time: 88% of participants had visible damage 6 weeks after being discharged from hospital, but by 12 weeks, this number had fallen to 56% (see [go.nature.com/3hiiopi](https://go.nature.com/3hiiopi)).
